# Shell script template

Starter template for shell scripts, that should help start your script with some useful utilities and setup some best
practices.

## Usage

You can just copy the content of the template into your script, or download a copy of the script directly and use that
as your starting point.

```shell script
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricLemieux/shell-script-template/master/template.sh" > my-new-script.sh
```

## Contributing

The template should follow the [Google shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html), this is
to improve consistency and to make it as easy to understand as possible.
